The "How People Get Hurt" dataset provides information on injuries treated in U.S. emergency rooms, including patient demographics such as age, sex, and race. It also includes the affected body part of the patient and the diagnosis for each injury, offering insights into the severity and type of injury. This data enables analysis of how these demographic factors relate to different types of injuries.
